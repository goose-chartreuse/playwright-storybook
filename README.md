# Playwright + Storybook

## Key features ü™¥

- **Visual Regression Testing**: Integrate Playwright with Storybook to perform reliable visual regression tests. Ensure your components remain visually consistent across updates by capturing and comparing screenshots.

- **Automated Storybook Loading**: Automatically wait for Storybook to be fully loaded before performing tests, reducing flaky results and ensuring consistent test outcomes.

- **Reusable URL Utility**: Simplified URL generation for accessing specific Storybook stories through a custom utility function. This reduces hardcoding and makes tests more maintainable and modular.

- **Dynamic Screenshot Handling**: Capture screenshots for various components dynamically and compare them with baseline images using Pixelmatch, providing a clean mechanism for detecting visual changes.

- **Automated Cleanup**: Efficiently manage new screenshots and diffs by deleting them automatically if they match the baseline, keeping the workspace clean and organized.

- **Playwright Report Integration**: Attach diff images to Playwright test reports for easy inspection of visual mismatches, making it easier to identify and debug issues when tests fail.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Ensure you have Playwright, Storybook, Pixelmatch, and PNGjs installed as development dependencies.

2. **Run Storybook**:

   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

   This command will start Storybook on the default port (6006).

3. **Run Visual Regression Tests**:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   This command will execute Playwright tests that interact with Storybook components and compare visual snapshots.

4. **View Playwright Test Reports**:

   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

   Open the HTML report to inspect any failing tests and see attached diff images for failed visual comparisons.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

| Technology    | Purpose                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Playwright    | Browser automation and testing framework |
| Storybook     | Isolated component development tool      |
| Pixelmatch    | Image comparison for visual regression   |
| PNGjs         | PNG image reading and manipulation       |
| Node.js       | JavaScript runtime environment           |

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

- **`/screenshots`**: Stores baseline and new screenshots.
- **`/screenshots/diffs`**: Stores diff images generated during visual regression tests.
- **`/tests`**: Contains Playwright tests that run against Storybook.
- **`/utils`**: Helper utilities for generating Storybook URLs and handling screenshots.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Loading Stories**: The tests use a utility to generate Storybook URLs dynamically, enabling easy access to specific stories.
- **Taking Screenshots**: Screenshots of components are taken after ensuring Storybook is fully loaded and components are rendered.
- **Image Comparison**: Pixelmatch is used to compare the new screenshots against the baseline. If a mismatch is detected, a diff image is saved and attached to the Playwright report.

## Future Improvements üå±

- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Automate visual regression tests in CI/CD pipelines to detect visual changes early in the development process.
- **Custom Thresholds**: Allow customizable Pixelmatch thresholds to control the sensitivity of visual comparisons.
- **Component-level Isolation**: Add functionality to test isolated components more thoroughly, including props and events.
